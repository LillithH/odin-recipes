    <h3>Bibimbap is a tasty meal that often features rice, veggies, beef or shrimp, a fried egg, and spicy gochujang sauce!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    

    <li>1 english cucumber</li>
    <li>1/4 cup gochujang (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh spinach</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 carrots, cut into matchsticks</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons gochujang, divided (or to taste)</li>


    <h2>Steps</h2>    
        <ol>
            <li>Stir cucumber pieces with 1/4 cup gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring about 2 cups of water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until spinach is bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir soy sauce into spinach.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in large nonstick skillet and cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes; stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Stir in cucumber pieces with gochujang paste; sprinkle with red pepper flakes, and set the mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side, and set aside. In a separate nonstick skillet, heat 1 more teaspoon olive oil over medium-low heat and fry the eggs just on one side until yolks are runny but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes each.</li>
            <li>To assemble the dish, divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</li>
