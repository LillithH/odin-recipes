Hi everyone, my name is Lillith. I'm using TheOdinProject to jump start my career as a programmer. This is my first introduction to progiramming, and this project was the first time I've ever written anything related to the field. I feel like just this short brush with HTML taught me a lot about using git and vscode. I hope to revisit this project and give it even more life than I've given it here!
